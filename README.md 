# GoRest API Automation – CRUD Testing

## Overview

This project is a simple API automation framework created to test the GoRest Users API.
It automates the complete CRUD flow (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and verifies that the APIs are working correctly by validating responses, status codes, and error scenarios.

The project is designed in a clean and easy-to-understand way to demonstrate how real-world API automation works.

---

## Objective of the Project

The main goal of this project is to automate user-related APIs and verify their behaviour using automation.

This project performs:

- Creating a new user using API
- Fetching the same user using generated user ID
- Updating user details
- Deleting the user
- Verifying that the user is deleted
- Running a negative test using invalid user ID

Each step checks whether the API response is correct.

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Maven
- RestAssured
- TestNG
- Jackson
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

---

## API Details

**Base URL:**
https://gorest.co.in

**APIs automated:**

- POST /public/v2/users → Create user
- GET /public/v2/users/{userId} → Get user
- PUT /public/v2/users/{userId} → Update user
- DELETE /public/v2/users/{userId} → Delete user

**Authentication:**
Bearer token is used and stored in the `config.properties` file.

---

## Project Structure

The project is divided into simple modules:

- BaseTest → handles base URL and authorization setup
- UserApiClient → contains API request methods
- User model → stores user request and response data
- Utils → helper classes for configuration and random data
- UserCrudTest → main test class that runs complete CRUD automation

---

## How the Project Works

When the automation test runs, it executes the following flow:

### 1. Create User

- Sends POST request with random user details
- API returns user data and user ID
- Status code 201 is validated

### 2. Get User

- Sends GET request using created user ID
- Confirms user data is correct
- Status code 200 is validated

### 3. Update User

- Updates user name or status
- Confirms updated data in response
- Status code 200 is validated

### 4. Delete User

- Deletes the user using DELETE request
- Status code 204 is validated

### 5. Verify Deletion

- Sends GET request again for same user
- API returns 404 (user not found)

### 6. Negative Test

- Sends request with invalid user ID
- API returns error response (404)

---

## Output of the Project

When the test runs, detailed execution logs are shown in the terminal:

- User created successfully
- User fetched successfully
- User updated successfully
- User deleted successfully
- Deletion verified
- Negative test executed


Final output:

Tests run: 2
Failures: 0
BUILD SUCCESS

This confirms that all API operations executed successfully.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure these are installed:

* Java
* Maven
* IntelliJ IDEA

---

### Setup Steps

1. Download or clone the project
2. Open the project in IntelliJ
3. Add GoRest token in:

src/test/resources/config.properties

Example:

base.url= https://gorest.co.in
auth.token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

---

### Run Tests

Option 1 – IntelliJ
Right click on UserCrudTest → Run

Option 2 – Terminal

Navigate to project folder and run:

mvn test

---

## Validations Covered

* HTTP status code validation
* Response data validation
* Header validation
* Negative testing
* Request chaining

---

## Final Result

The automation successfully performs complete CRUD operations and validates the API responses step-by-step.
All tests passed successfully with no failures.

This project demonstrates a simple and structured way of implementing API automation.
